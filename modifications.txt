1.Structural Organization:
 The code is now logically segmented into clear steps (data loading, preprocessing, etc.) with descriptive comments explaining each section's purpose.

2. Error Handling: 
Added robust try-except blocks when loading yearly data to gracefully handle potential issues without crashing the entire process, while still logging errors for debugging.

3. Data Cleaning:

Automatically strips whitespace from all column names to prevent potential issues with column references
Explicitly drops the empty 'Unnamed: 7' column that served no purpose
Standardizes column naming between commodity and industry datasets

4.Code Clarity:

Added detailed docstrings and comments explaining each major operation
Used more descriptive variable names (df_com/df_ind instead of df_1/df_2)
Included print statements to show progress and verify outputs

5.Maintainability:

Created a cleaner workflow for combining annual datasets
Structured the code to make future enhancements easier (like adding preprocessing steps)
Separated data loading from transformation logic.

6. Future-Proofing:

The code structure makes it easy to add additional preprocessing steps
Designed to handle potential data quality issues that might arise
Includes placeholders for common data science tasks like missing value handling
